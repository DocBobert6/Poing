/**
 * Phase 6 (item 8) fix — RetroAchievements login errors.
 *
 * The login failed on Robert's device with "No response". The
 * cause, verified against the live endpoint: the RA login
 * endpoint answers a rejected login with HTTP 401 and a JSON
 * body ({"Success":false,...,"Error":"Invalid user/token
 * combination."}), but [RaClient]'s HTTP request discarded the
 * body for every non-200 status, so the native layer got an
 * empty body and rcheevos reported RC_NO_RESPONSE — "No
 * response". The server had answered; the app threw the answer
 * away.
 *
 * This object holds the pure (Android-free) pieces of the fix:
 * reading a response body for every status, classifying a
 * transport failure into the status rcheevos maps to a named
 * error, and turning rcheevos' raw error strings into the plain
 * message the Settings screen shows. Nothing here touches
 * Android, Compose, or coroutines, so it is covered by the
 * pure-test harness (RaLoginErrorsTest).

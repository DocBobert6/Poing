/**
 * Phase 6 (item 8) — RetroAchievements: the achievement model.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, so it is covered by the pure-test harness. The JSON
 * comes from the native layer (nativeRaGetAchievements), which
 * builds it from the rc_client list; each entry carries the id,
 * title, description, points, state, and — for measured
 * achievements — the progress string and percent. Badge images
 * are out of scope for v1 (no image loader in the project),
 * so no badge URL is carried.
 *
 * States mirror rc_client_achievement_state: INACTIVE (0) means
 * the achievement can never be earned in this game, ACTIVE (1)
 * means it can, UNLOCKED (2) means the player earned it, and
 * DISABLED (3) means the game is not fully loaded or the
 * achievement is unsupported. The list screen shows unlocked and
 * active achievements; inactive ones are hidden.
 *
 * The JSON is parsed by the minimal parser below, not org.json:
 * org.json is a stub in android.jar (it throws "Stub!" on the
 * plain JVM), which is why UpdateChecker — the only other
 * org.json user — is not in the pure-test harness. The parser
 * only needs the native layer's shape: an array of flat objects
 * whose values are strings, numbers, or (for robustness)
 * true/false/null.
